# Recurrence Analysis -- Mystery Function

Analyze the running time of the following recursive procedure as a function of
$n$ and find a tight big $O$ bound on the runtime for the function. You may
assume that each operation takes unit time. You do not need to provide a formal
proof, but you should show your work: at a minimum, show the recurrence relation
you derive for the runtime of the code, and then how you solved the recurrence
relation.

```javascript
function mystery(n) {
    if(n <= 1)
        return;
    else {
        mystery(n / 3);
        var count = 0;
        mystery(n / 3);
        for(var i = 0; i < n*n; i++) {
            for(var j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for(var k = 0; k < n*n; k++) {
                    count = count + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        mystery(n / 3);
    }
}
```

might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

When going through the loops the first one is n* n, the second is just n and the third is also n*n so the total time for the loops is $(n^2) * n * (n^2) = n^5$ so O(n^5). The function is recursively called 3 times and since it is divided by 3 the time complexity of that is log3(n). The total complexity is O(log3(n)*n^5)
